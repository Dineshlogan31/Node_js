1.the eventloop is a c program thar orchestrates or co-ordinate the execution of synchronous and 
asynchronous code in node js

2.it co-ordinates the execution of callback in six different queues

3.they are nextTick,promise,timer ,I/O,check and close queues

4.we use nextTick() method to queue into the nextTick queue
5.we resolve or reject a promise to queue into the promise queue
6.we use setTimeout or setInterval  to queue into the nextTick queue
7.Execue an async method to queue into the I/O queue
8.use setImmediate function to queue into the check queue and finally
9.Attack close event listeners to queue into the close queue

10.The order of execution follow the same order listed here

//Important
11.nextTick and promise queues are executed in between each queue and also in between each
   callback execution in the timer and check queues
